          Findings and Recommendations
          ----------------------------
 
Finding 1: Sequence Usage
Impact is 1.06 active sessions, 48.72% of total activity.
---------------------------------------------------------
Sequence cache misses were consuming significant database time.
 
   Recommendation 1: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is 1.06 active sessions, 48.72% of total activity.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate application or look at top SQL to find hot sequences. Use a 
      larger cache size for those sequences. Try avoiding the use of the ORDER 
      setting if running RAC.
 
 
Finding 2: Top SQL Statements
Impact is 1.06 active sessions, 48.57% of total activity.
---------------------------------------------------------
SQL statements consuming significant database time were found. These 
statements offer a good opportunity for performance improvement.
 
   Recommendation 1: SQL Tuning
   Estimated benefit is .62 active sessions, 28.57% of total activity.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the DELETE statement with SQL_ID "dvk3xq859zsb6" for 
      possible performance improvements. You can supplement the information 
      given here with an ASH report for this SQL_ID.
      Related Object
         SQL statement with SQL_ID dvk3xq859zsb6.
         DELETE FROM REGIONBACKUP WHERE REGIONID = :B1 
   Rationale
      The SQL spent only 1% of its database time on CPU, I/O and Cluster 
      waits. Therefore, the SQL Tuning Advisor is not applicable in this case. 
      Look at performance data for the SQL to find potential improvements.
   Rationale
      Database time for this SQL was divided as follows: 100% for SQL 
      execution, 0% for parsing, 0% for PL/SQL execution and 0% for Java 
      execution.
   Rationale
      Waiting for event "log file switch (archiving needed)" in wait class 
      "Configuration" accounted for 95% of the database time spent in 
      processing the SQL statement with SQL_ID "dvk3xq859zsb6".
   Rationale
      Top level calls to execute the PL/SQL statement with SQL_ID 
      "a8c4tzpybxwj6" are responsible for 100% of the database time spent on 
      the DELETE statement with SQL_ID "dvk3xq859zsb6".
      Related Object
         SQL statement with SQL_ID a8c4tzpybxwj6.
         
 
   Recommendation 2: SQL Tuning
   Estimated benefit is .44 active sessions, 20% of total activity.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the UPDATE statement with SQL_ID "4m7m0t6fjcs5x" for 
      possible performance improvements. You can supplement the information 
      given here with an ASH report for this SQL_ID.
      Related Object
         SQL statement with SQL_ID 4m7m0t6fjcs5x.
         update seq$ set increment$=:2,minvalue=:3,maxvalue=:4,cycle#=:5,order
         $=:6,cache=:7,highwater=:8,audit$=:9,flags=:10 where obj#=:1
   Rationale
      The SQL spent only 0% of its database time on CPU, I/O and Cluster 
      waits. Therefore, the SQL Tuning Advisor is not applicable in this case. 
      Look at performance data for the SQL to find potential improvements.
   Rationale
      Database time for this SQL was divided as follows: 100% for SQL 
      execution, 0% for parsing, 0% for PL/SQL execution and 0% for Java 
      execution.
   Rationale
      Waiting for event "log file switch (archiving needed)" in wait class 
      "Configuration" accounted for 100% of the database time spent in 
      processing the SQL statement with SQL_ID "4m7m0t6fjcs5x".
 
 
Finding 3: Slow Archivers
Impact is 1 active sessions, 45.81% of total activity.
------------------------------------------------------
Archiver processes were unable to keep up with redo generation.
This problem can be caused by use of hot backup mode on tablespaces.  DML to 
tablespaces in hot backup mode causes generation of additional redo, thereby 
increasing the work of archiver processes.
 
   Recommendation 1: Host Configuration
   Estimated benefit is 1 active sessions, 45.81% of total activity.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the file I/O throughput of the archiver process(es) to make 
      sure it is appropriate for the underlying hardware.
   Rationale
      The archiver's I/O throughput was 0 K per second on redo log files and 0 
      K per second on archive and archive backup log files.
   Rationale
      The total I/O throughput on redo log files was 5.1 M per second and the 
      archiver was responsible for 0% of it.
 
   Recommendation 2: Database Configuration
   Estimated benefit is 1 active sessions, 45.81% of total activity.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Consider adding more archiver processes by setting the value of 
      parameter "log_archive_max_processes".
   Rationale
      The value of parameter "log_archive_max_processes" was "4" during the 
      analysis period.
 
   Symptoms That Led to the Finding:
   ---------------------------------
      Wait class "Configuration" was consuming significant database time.
      Impact is 1.71 active sessions, 78.25% of total activity.
 
 
Finding 4: Unusual "Configuration" Wait Event
Impact is .69 active sessions, 31.8% of total activity.
-------------------------------------------------------
Wait event "enq: SQ - contention" in wait class "Configuration" was consuming 
significant database time.
 
   Recommendation 1: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is .69 active sessions, 31.8% of total activity.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the cause for high "enq: SQ - contention" waits. Refer to 
      Oracle's "Database Reference" for the description of this wait event.
 
   Recommendation 2: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is .69 active sessions, 31.8% of total activity.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action

      "SYS$USERS".
 
   Recommendation 3: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is .69 active sessions, 31.8% of total activity.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the cause for high "enq: SQ - contention" waits with P1 
      ("name|mode") value "1397817350" and P2 ("object #") value "8912".
 
   Symptoms That Led to the Finding:
   ---------------------------------
      Wait class "Configuration" was consuming significant database time.
      Impact is 1.71 active sessions, 78.25% of total activity.
 
 
Finding 5: Unusual "Administrative" Wait Event
Impact is .06 active sessions, 2.92% of total activity.
-------------------------------------------------------
Wait event "JS kgl get object wait" in wait class "Administrative" was 
consuming significant database time.
 
   Recommendation 1: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is .06 active sessions, 2.92% of total activity.
